# CRISP-DM data science workflow

> Cross-industry standard process for data mining (CRISP-DM)

## Sample workflow

1.  Business understanding - what is the business problem/need?
2.  Data understanding - What data do we have vs. need? What are our
    sources? How is data structured? Where is is stored?
3.  Data preparation
4.  Modeling - What modeling techniques should we use?
5.  Evaluation - Which model best meets the business objectives?
6.  Deployment - How do stakeholders access the results?

## Including Code

You can include R code in the document as follows:

``` r
summary(cars)
```

    ##      speed           dist       
    ##  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
    ##  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
    ##  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
    ##  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
    ##  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
    ##  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to
prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
